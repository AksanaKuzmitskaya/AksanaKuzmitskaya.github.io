Hi, my dear running enthusiast!

I want to share my running tips with you, that I collected from my personal experience, conversations with professional runner athletes, running videos, books, and articles. 

But first, let me tell you about my running experience.
I am passionate about running and really enjoy it!
I've been running regularly since 2013 for my pleasure. In the past year, I started training for races. I have completed 9+1 program with [NYRR] [nyrr-page] club to earn guaranteed entry to the TCS New York City Marathon 2018, where I ran 9 races and 2 of them are half marathons with average pace 7:50 per mile or 4:52 per km, total I ran half marathon in 1:42:40! I am very excited about it!

Occasionally, I get asked how to start running, that is why I decided to write this post. 

So, let's get started!

1. Start running with short distances and gradually increase them. The pace shouldn't interrupt your breathing, you should be able to speak easily while running. 

2. Don't eat 1-2 hours before your run, depends on your digestion system. My favorite is to run in the morning on an empty stomach.   

3. Run whenever you have time. I like to run in the morning, at lunchtime or at night, depends on my mood and timing availability. Every time has its own beauty anyways.
    Mornings are good because you get to start your day energized on a good note. You can plan your day while running, new ideas might come into your mind.  Sunrises are beautiful to watch.
    Here is the picture of a sunrise I saw while running one morning in the mountains of Cala Boquer in Spain.

    Lunchtime is good if you sit all day in the office and it is nice to get out and spend some time outside, clear your thoughts, get fresh air. After a run, you can have a yummy smoothie or a healthy juice. As a software engineer I solve problems all day long and running at lunch helped me many times to find solutions to difficult problems.
    
    Night time is gorgeous, you get to run with the playing night lights and it's a good time to meditate and get ready for your sleep.

4. Track your progress with an app. I personally love [runkeeper][runkeeper-page]. 

    It gives you a lot of data and statistics. Also, it gives you updates on your current distance, time and pace, average pace. You can create your own custom workouts there. I like to create interval training. You can follow your friends there and get updates when they completed their run.

5. It's good to have a plan in mind, like running once a week or every other day. 

Enjoy your run!
