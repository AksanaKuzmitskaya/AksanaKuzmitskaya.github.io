Hi, my dear running enthusiast!
I want to share my running tips with you, that I collected from my personal experience, conversations with professional runners, running videos, books, and articles. 

>**My running experience:**
I am very passionate about running and have been running regularly for my pleasure since 2013. In the past year, I started training for races. I have completed 9+1 program with [NYRR] [nyrr-page] club to earn guaranteed entry to the TCS New York City Marathon 2018, where I ran 9 races and 2 of them are half marathons with average pace 7:50 per mile or 4:52 per km, total I ran half marathon in 1:42:40! I am very excited about it!

Occasionally, I get asked how to start running, that is why I decided to write this post. 

## 1\. Short Distance

Start running with the short distance and gradually increase it. The pace shouldn't interrupt your breathing. You should be able to speak easily while running.

## 2\. Empty Stomach

Don't eat 1-2 hours before your run, depends on your digestion system. My favorite is to run in the morning on an empty stomach.   

## 3\. Any Time 

Run whenever you have time. I like to run in the morning, at lunchtime or at night, depends on my mood and timing availability. Every time has its own beauty anyways.

**Mornings** are good because you get to start your day energized on a good note. You can plan your day while running, new ideas might come into your mind.  Sunrises are beautiful to watch.
Here is the picture of a sunrise I saw while running one morning in the mountains of Cala Boquer in Spain.

**Lunchtime** is good if you sit all day in the office and it is nice to get out and spend some time outside, clear your thoughts, get fresh air. After a run, you can have a yummy smoothie or a healthy juice. As a software engineer I solve problems all day long and running at lunch helped me many times to find solutions to difficult problems.

**Nighttime** is gorgeous, you get to run with the playing night lights and it's a good time to meditate and get ready for your sleep.

## 4\. Fitness-tracking App

Track your progress with an app. I personally love [runkeeper][runkeeper-page].

As you can see from the screenshots above, it gives you a lot of data and statistics. Also, it gives you updates on your current distance, time and pace, average pace. You can create your own custom workouts there. I like to create interval training. You can follow your friends there and get updates when they completed their run.

## 5\. Dynamic and Static Stretch

Stretching is **important** for an injury-free run. When I was just doing my first runs I just got out and ran and got injured a couple of times, don't follow my mistakes. 

Before I run I like to stretch **dynamically**. Usually, I do 10 sit-ups, shoulder rollouts, etc...

A **static** stretch is very rewarding after you have completed your run. 

Recently I have discovered a **foam roller** for myself and it's amazing, especially if you are planning to become a long distance runner.

## 6\. Running Gear

Nike shoes

## 7\. Other Activities

Yoga, pilates, swimming, weights.



It's good to have a plan in mind, like running once a week or every other day. 
Enjoy your run!
