Start running with short distances. The pace shouldn't interrupt your breathing. It's good to have a plan in mind, like running once a week or every other day. 

Don't eat 1-2 hours before your run, depends on your digestion system. My favorite is to run in the morning on an empty stomach.   

You can run whenever you have time. I like to run in the morning, at lunchtime or at night, depends on my mood and timing. Every time has its own beauty anyways.

Mornings are good because you get to start your day energized and you can plan your day while running, also new ideas might come into your mind.  Sunrises are beautiful to watch.
Lunchtime is good if you sit all day in the office and it is nice to get out and spend some time outside, clear your thoughts, get fresh air. After a run, you can have a yummy smoothie. As a software engineer if I am stuck with the problem I need to solve running at lunch helped me many times.
Night time is gorgeous with the lights and it's a good time to meditate and get ready for sleep.

Track your progress with an app. I personally love [runkeeper][runkeeper-page]. It tells you distance, average pace, the current pace you running. You also can make custom workouts there, like interval training, etc.
