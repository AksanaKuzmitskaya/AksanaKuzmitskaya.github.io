Hi, my dear running enthusiast!
I want to share my running tips with you, that I collected from my personal experience, conversations with professional runners, running videos, books, and articles. 

>**My running experience:**
I am very passionate about running and have been running regularly for my pleasure since 2013. In the past year, I started training for races. I have completed 9+1 program with [NYRR] [nyrr-page] club to earn guaranteed entry to the TCS New York City Marathon 2018, where I ran 9 races and 2 of them are half marathons. I am very excited about it! 
My best half marathon was Popular Brooklyn Half Marathon which I ran with average pace 7:30 per mile or 4:39 per km and finished it in 1:38:08!

Occasionally, I get asked how to start running and any useful tips I can give, that is why I decided to write this post. 

## 1\. Short Distance

Start running with the short distance and gradually increase it. The pace shouldn't interrupt your breathing. You should be able to speak easily while running.

## 2\. Empty Stomach

Don't eat 1-2 hours before your run, of course, it depends on your digestion system. My favorite is to run in the morning on an empty stomach.  

## 3\. Any Time 

Run whenever you have time. I like to run in the morning, at lunchtime or at night, depends on my mood and timing availability. Every time has its own beauty anyways.

**Mornings** are good because you get to start your day energized and on a good note. There are several things you can do while running in the morning: planning your day, getting new ideas into your mind or just smiling and enjoying the rising sun.  Sunrises are beautiful to watch.

**Lunchtime** is good if you sit all day in the office and it is a perfect time to get out and spend some time outside, clear your thoughts, get fresh air and get your body moving. After a run, you can have a yummy smoothie or a healthy juice for the extra energy boost. As a software engineer I solve problems all day long and running at lunch helped me many times to find solutions to difficult problems.

**Nighttime** is so magical, you get to run with the playing lights of the night and it's a great time to meditate and get ready for your sleep.

## 4\. Fitness-tracking App

Track your progress with an app. I personally love [runkeeper][runkeeper-page].

As you can see from the screenshots above, it gives you a lot of useful data and statistics. While running, the app gives you updates on your current distance, total time and pace, average pace. You can create your own custom workouts there. I like to create interval training. You can follow your friends there and get updates when they complete their run.

## 5\. Dynamic and Static Stretches

**Stretching is important** for an injury-free run. When I was doing my first runs, I just got out and ran and got injured a couple of times, don't follow my mistakes. 

Now, before each run, I like to stretch **dynamically**. Usually, I do: 

* 10 sit-ups, 
* shoulder rollouts, 
* calf & hamstring stretch,
* arm circles, 
* dynamic standing quad stretch,
* feet stretch,
* deep side lounges, etc.

**Static** stretches after you completed your run are very rewarding. My favorite post-run static stretches are:

* thigh hug,
* resistance leg,
* triceps & shoulder stretches,
* seated head to knee,
* pigeon,
* shoulder stand, etc.

Recently I have discovered a **foam roller** for myself and it's amazing, especially if you are planning to become a long distance runner. I follow this video

## 6\. Running Gear

Get yourself a nice running outfit, you will feel good about yourself and it will make a run more comfortable and fun. Adidas by Stella McCartney is an excellent and unique balance between fashion, functionality plus design.

My favorite running shoes so far are [Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 34][nike-shoes-page].

## 7\. Other Activities

To improve your running form and performance I encourage you to try yoga or pilates, swimming, weights. I usually go 3 times a week to different yoga classes, once a week I do pilates and weights and I really want to incorporate more swimming into my exercise routine. 

## 8\. Plan

Have a plan in your mind: running once a week or every other day, and stick to it. Find the best plan for you, be consistent and have fun.
